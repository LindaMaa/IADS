Different approaches to the Traveling Salesman Problem:
- swap adjacent nodes in a sequence
- reverse substring of a sequence
- 2-Opt
- 3-Opt
- Greedy approach 
- Dynamic algorithm (polynomial time)
- Reference dynamic algorithm (finds optimal solution but in exponential time)

Tests:
- tests for non-metric & euclidean graphs
- comparing different approaches to TSP 
- visualizing cost with respect to different TSP approaches and different graph sizes
